I am the Arm Software Lead which is a subteam of the subsystem GNC(Guidence, Navigation, and Control). During my time here I was asked to implement a joystick teleoperable arm software so that the arm could complete numerous tasks such as pulling and picking up objects, and typing on the keyboard. With this, the mechanical subsystem provides me with an arm design and I am responsible of simulating the arm using a URDF(Unified Robot Description Format) and implementing the arm controls using ROS.
