<p>ManoaNow is known to be a service to both students and companies. ManoaNow has implemented a campus map that students are able to use to navigate throughout campus similar to a GPS where it gives directions. Whether the user is finding food spots, hidden buildings, or even the nearest restrooms ManoaNow provides the location. Along with that, ManoaNow provides news updates on the website and current events that are happening throughout campus. Future events can also be found on a calendar that ManoaNow has incorporated with the app which presents upcoming events throughout campus. Finally, the other benefits of ManoaNow is that you are able to find new job opportunities, UH deals, and find routes of the UH Manoa shuttle bus. Not only students, but companies are able to benefit from ManoaNow where they are able to advertise their business on the ManoaNow website or app.</p>

<p>I started working for ManoaNow in September 2022 after searching for an entry-level software engineering position on-campus. For this project, I was in charge of the ManoaNow app where I wrote in javascript using the React Native framework. I communicated back and forth with our Software Engineer lead and the design team to produce a sufficient app that satisfies both the design team’s and software team’s standards. Specifically, I worked on the job opportunities feature on the app where I had to pull information from firebase that comes through the admin portal and present it in an attractive and readable fashion so that the consumer could adequately gather the information that they needed.</p>

<p>You can learn more about the ManoaNow <a href="https://www.manoanow.org/">here</a> or download the ManoaNow app on the App Store or Google Play.</p>
