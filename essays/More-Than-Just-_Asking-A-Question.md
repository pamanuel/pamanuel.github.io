## Significance of Asking the Smart Question
Have you ever been in a class where the instructure says "There are no stupid question." That is a lie, we've all seen that one student who asked a stupid question and the instructor just sighs. Communication is key when it comes to asking questions so that the person recieving the question can understand and answer it. Specifically with software engineering, software engineers always come accross a problem where they can't find the answer to. Communication is key when communcating a problem with the lead engineer, finding answers on forums, or even communicating with google. Asking the wrong question will evidently lead to an unsatisfactory answer where the problem isn't even answered. 

Prior to asking a question, prepare on the type of question that you want to ask. Broad questions will make you seem arrogant, showing your lack of effort of trying to find the answer yourself. Keep in mind, people probably will not respond to you if you asked them a question that is very broad and easy to find on google. To avoid this, be specific on what you are working towards so that the problem asker and reciever are on the same page. Assure the reader that you know what you are talking about. Being specific, can also narrow down the solution that you are looking for. The reader of the question should be able to abstract the question so that they know exactly what is being asked. Furthermore, when asking a question, try to answer the question first, be specific, show what've done, and make your question readable. Tell a story about your thought process and the problem.

When you start to understand the difference between smart and stupid questions the more you are likely to find an answer. Relating to software engineering, when reading a smart question you will be able to abstract the question and understand other engineers thought process and vice versa. Skipping the middle stage of not knowing how to ask a question will increase efficiency and productivity, as you will be able to find answers quicker and comprehend the questions faster. Thus, it is essential for software engineers to understand how to ask and read smart questions.
