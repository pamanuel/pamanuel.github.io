## High School Future Thoughts
During high school all that was on my mind was being valedictorian and basketball. Sure, I succeeded in both aspects, I became a valedictorian and a captain on the varsity basketball team but I haven't put much thought into what I was going to do after high school. However, I always knew I wanted to be an engineer, I knew since I was a little kid, but I didn't know what type of engineer. My high school self couldn't even tell you what each type of engineer does. I always thought an engineer is an engineer. With a very civil and mechanical heavy engineering department in my high school I leaned towards becoming a mechanical engineer. That's what I declared as entering college knowing I don't have a good understanding of what a mechanical engineer does other than it sounds cooler.

## The Switch 
After my freshman year of college, I still had no idea what I was going into with a mechanical engineer major. Through this time, I started to question is this where I want to be. After reaching out to a lot of my friends that I kept in touch with after high school, they mostly went into a computer science, electrical engineering, or computer engineering degree. I then searched up who makes the most money and which degree is the most rewarding, it turned out to be computer engineering. The rest is history.

## The Goal
Once declaring as a computer engineer, I figured that I should set myself up for success by joining different clubs and projects so that I could find the type of work that I would be wanting to do right after college. With this, I joined VIP Team RoSE which is very robotics heavy. Though I don't have a strong interest in robotics, I realized that the people in RoSE  are very well-driven aspiring software engineers and I believe that surrounding yourself with other well-driven people is needed to succeed.
