## Why A Framework
Prior to this class, I never had a full understanding of what a framework even was. Whenever I asked my peers I would always get the response, "It's used to give you something similar to functions that you can work off of." Though it was true and it made sense, it still never gave me a good understanding of what a framework was. In this class, I understood that frameworks are like shortcuts, and it helps simplify and ease the stress of a person who codes. Specifically, in this class we used Bootstrap 5 as a framework and with this, a lot of classes were premade. This eased the previous tasks of creating a website while using raw html and css. For instance, we had to create the grid classes, rows and columns, in html and css, but in Bootstrap it was already premade and all we had to do was call the class. All in all, frameworks are used to speed up productivity in software development.

## Learning Curve
Though frameworks are very useful and can be used to improve code productivity, there is a learning curve to them as we are using premade classes. The difficulty in this is because the classes are premade.
